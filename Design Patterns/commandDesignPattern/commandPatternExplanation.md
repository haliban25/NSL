# Command Pattern
Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation allows pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

## When to use :
- when we want to parametrize objects with operations.
- when we want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
- when we want to implement reversible operations.
