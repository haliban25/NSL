# Project Management
## Requirements analysis
## Task breakdown
## Effort estimation

## Task prioritization (use case, multiple overlapping tasks)

- Write everything down: Personal and work tasks should be captured in one place.
- Evaluate long-term goals: Consider your larger long-term goals, and the work you need to do to reach them. 
- Break down larger goals: To understand how to achieve your long-term goals, break them down into yearly, monthly, and weekly achievements. 
- Create clear deadlines: Give yourself full visibility of deadlines, and create deadlines for yourself when none are formally required. 
- Employ the urgent-versus-important method: Prioritize urgent and important tasks; set a specific time to work on important nonurgent tasks; and delegate or remove all other tasks. 
- Create a daily MIT (Most important Task) list: Write down three important tasks that should be done that day. These tasks should always relate to your larger, future goals. 
- Avoid distractions: Intentionally steer clear of competing tasks, especially as task difficulty increases. 
- Consider effort: When your task list is becoming too much, prioritize according to effort and breeze through those easier tasks more quickly.

## Task or project timeline/ gantt chart design

A timeline is a representation of a list of events in sequential order. It is typically a visual design presenting a long bar named with dates paralleling it, and normally contemporaneous events; a Gantt chart is a form of timeline adopted in project management.

In contrast, a Gantt chart is a graphic/visual representation of your project timeline that gives project tasks related to time. Specific tasks are represented as horizontal bars, and the length of the bar designates how long that task is assumed to take.

## Flowchart vs Activity diagram
|-| Flowchart | Activity Diagram |
|-|------------------|------------------|
|Definition| A flowchart is a diagrammatic representation that illustrates a solution model to a given problem.|An activity diagram is a graphical representation of workflows of stepwise activities and actions with support for choice, iteration, and concurrency.|
|Usage|A flowchart helps to analyze and design a program. | an activity diagram helps to understand the business process or workflow of the system. |
|Association|A flowchart is associated with programming.| An activity diagram is associated with UML.|
