# ER Diagram Best Practices

## Follow a Naming Convention  
- Name every entity, and attribute on your diagram.
- Provide a precise and appropriate name for each entity, attribute, and relationship in the diagram. Terms that are simple and familiar always beats vague, technical-sounding words. In naming entities, remember to use singular nouns. However, adjectives may be used to distinguish entities belonging to the same class (part-time employee and full-time employee, for example). Meanwhile attribute names must be meaningful, unique, system-independent, and easily understandable.

## Make sure that each entity only appears once per diagram.

## Examine relationships between entities closely
- Name every relationship on your diagram.
- Eliminate vague, redundant or unnecessary relationships between entities.
- Never connect a relationship to another relationship.

##  Avoid Overlapping References
In an ER diagram, relationships between entities are denoted by reference lines. When there are tens or hundreds of tables, it’s easy to get confused by reference lines overlapping each other or hiding behind entities. In some complex data models, you may not be able to remove all overlaps. However, minimizing overlaps increases the readability and navigability of your ER diagram.
## Make effective use of colors
- You can use colors to classify similar entities or to highlight key areas in your diagrams.
## Create Subject Areas
- Just like an application can usually be divided into several services based on the domain, ERD entities can be split into different domains called subject areas.
## Add Notes to Your ER Diagram   
- Complex ER diagrams also pose another problem: It’s often difficult to understand the context behind a table, a column, or any other type of database object. Adding a note on the reasoning behind your decision – why you chose a specific data type, etc. – will prove extremely helpful to the viewer.
## Use model formatting tools and utilities 
- to polish your model.
